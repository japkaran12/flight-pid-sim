# ✈️ Flight Stability & PID Simulator

A simple Python-based simulator to study aircraft pitch stability using a PID controller.

## Features
- Simulates aircraft pitch motion
- Real-time PID tuning (Kp, Ki, Kd)
- Visualizes pitch response curve
- Streamlit-based UI for easy testing

## Run Locally
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m streamlit run streamlit_app.py

## 🚀 **How to Run**
In VS Code terminal:
```bash
cd flight-pid-sim
python -m streamlit run streamlit_app.py
App khul jaayega browser me:
👉 http://localhost:8501

🌟 Output
Tu sliders se Kp, Ki, Kd badhata-ghata sakta hai

Graph real-time update hoga

Line overshoot karegi, settle karegi — ekdam like real flight control response
